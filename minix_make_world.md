## 1. Setting Up SSH

The following steps must be done as *root*.

- OpenSSH

```
pkgin install openssh
```

- Customize settings

```
Optionally, edit ///usr/pkg/etc/ssh/sshd_config//.
```

- Start *sshd*

```
reboot
```

or

```
sh /usr/pkg/etc/rc.d/sshd start
```

Security keys will be created automatically.

- If SSH connections fail…

Check if the *sshd* daemon is running.

```
ps ax | grep sshd
```

Next, check that it's listening to the appropriate port.

```
tcpstat -a | grep ssh
```

## 2. Obtaining the Sources from the Git repository

- You'll be grabbing a new “/usr/src” tree, which will contain Git metafiles also.
- Obtain the toolkit from pkgin_sets

```
# pkgin up
# pkgin_sets
calculating dependencies... done.
[..]

proceed ? [y/N] y
```

- Do the git clone of the trunk of the source:

```
# cd /usr
# git clone git://git.minix3.org/minix src
Cloning into src...
```

- <!> **Read \*src/docs/UPDATING\* for any tips you might need.** <!>

Now, you have the “bleeding edge” of sources installed under “/usr/src”, and you can update to a later bleeding edge by saying,

```
# cd /usr/src
# git pull
```

at any time in the future.



## 3. Rebuilding the System

**Note:**

This is for building MINIX from within MINIX. To cross-compile MINIX from another Unix-like system, [check this page](https://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=developersguide:crosscompiling) instead.

## Rebuilding World

The easiest way is to execute `make build`. It will rebuild and install the operating system, as well as all the utilities.

Supposing you [have the MINIX source code](https://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=developersguide:trackingcurrent) under the `/usr/src` directory, these commands

```
$ su
# cd /usr/src
# make build
```

will create the necessary directories, proceed to install the new includes, create the necessary *.depend* files then build and install the new libraries; and then, create the necessary *.depend* files then build and install the commands and the system (servers, drivers, and kernel), and finally install it as a new image ready for reboot.

`make build` does nothing with configuration (*/etc*) files. Sometimes, it might be necessary to get new or updated */etc* files. There is no automated procedure for that, though. Compare files in *src/etc* and */etc*, and see if any updates have happened. Especially, an outdated */etc/system.conf* (or */etc/drivers.conf*) file can cause all sorts of problems.

In some instances, some necessary commands will have to be updated before, in order to make the new compiling work. Therefore, if `make build` fails unexpectedly, revise the `docs/UPDATING` document for instructions along the lines of running `make -C usr.bin/foobar && make -C usr.bin/foobar install`. Then, `make build` again.

## Rebuilding the Kernel Only

<!> In general, you should follow the process in “Rebuilding World”.

```
$ su
# cd /usr/src/releasetools   # this directory contains tools that make creating and installing the kernel easier
# make hdboot         # this installs the kernel to your hard disk
```

### Other Build Targets

Type

```
$ cd /usr/src/releasetools
$ make
```
