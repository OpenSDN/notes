As we cannot serve you a nice drink remotely, feel free to bring your own beverage to the call. We would like you to be as comfortable as possible and have a good interview experience with us! Also, we understand that you may not have a space available to quietly interview. Your partner, children, or pets may jump in from time to time. We totally get it! Feel free to introduce them, you may even meet some of our extended team members too while we work from home.  

**Interview Preparation** - What to expect:

- Interviews may be based on behavioral, situational, and/or technical questions.
- Questions are centered around typical challenges that you may face in your role, technology you have worked with in your past experiences, and what you'd like to plan to do next in the future.
- Prepare specific examples of problems you solved, what actions you took, what you learned from it, and how you have applied what you learned since then. You’ll want to demonstrate collaboration and being inclusive with a diverse team, problem-solving with relevant technologies, disruptive innovative thinking, and your excellent communication skills.
- Think about what questions you’ll want to ask each of your interviewers.
- Please come prepared to share why you’re interested in cybersecurity.

Please note that you may receive a 5-10 minute survey to tell us about your candidate experience! We would greatly appreciate it if you would share your feedback. The survey invite will be coming from [recruiting@paloaltonetworks.com](mailto:recruiting@paloaltonetworks.com), so if necessary, please add the email address to your list of approved senders.

Kindest regards and best of luck!
