### 1. **What is your greatest failure, and what did you learn from it? – (Behavior)**

 Talking about failures and mistakes during an interview can be uncomfortable and tricky. 

No one likes talking about a time when they screwed up especially during an interview.

 **Why they ask because they want to know:**

First what do you view as a failure (self-aware)

Second, how have you handled?

Third, what did you learn from the experience

 There is a method called STAR to answer questions like these. It stands for Situation, Task, Action, Result

**Avoid quantitative figures:**

·    $$$ amount

·    Number of customers

·    Number of hours lost

Examples:

·    Project could not finish on time

·    Communication (verbal vs. written)

·    Anything you did that effected the system (IT)

### 2. **Tell me time when you had to work with difficult people? – (Behavior)**

 **How to handle in sequence:**

·    Be calm and learn how he/she functions

 ·    Treat the person with respect. ...

 ·    Build a rapport. ...

 ·    **1:1 communication**

 ·    Ignore

 ·    Escalate

 **STAR method of my situation:**

S = New hire

T = Learn the system and the environment, groups or dept. we deal with

A = applied the above sequence and rapport

R = We became very good friends. We are still in touch 

### 3.**Describe a time when you were unable to complete your work on time and how you handle it? – (Behavior)**

 **Few tips to keep in mind**

·    Admit

·    Blame no one

·    Proper documentation

·    Communication

 **STAR method:**

 **Example of ad agency**

Project to deliver a video commercial to a client

·    Situation = Failed to deliver on time

·    Task = Research, development, QA, production

·    Action = Called your client / your boss

·    Result = Date extended



### 4.**Describe a time when you had a disagreement with your boss & how you handled it? – (Behavior)** 

Before getting into any disagreement

·    All facts together

·    Documentation (pros vs. cons)

·    Ask questions

·    1:1 communication

·    Be respectful and move on

 My example of moving to Virtualization

 **STAR method:**

S = She was not buying into virtualization

T = Getting her to learn about virtualization, its application and implementation in our environment

A = Trained myself, gathered facts about virtualization, documentation, pros vs. cons.

R = Finally deployed



### 5. Tell me about a successful presentation you gave and why you think it was a hit?

 Apply:  S.T.A.R method

 Situation:          A presentation on how to improve customer service

 Task                  Use PowerPoint software with animations and go through the presentation

 Action               Understand the audience

​			   Gathered supporting documents, statistics, proven models

​		           Combined ideas from the team

​			   Put together the contents to be included

​                           Use big fonts

​                           Provide slides notes to the audience

Result               New procedure was approved and implemented

 

### 6. Tell me about the toughest decision you've had to make and the outcome?

 Why the interviewer is asking

The interviewer wants to find out both what you consider to be your hardest decision and how/why you made the decision

 Tips: Stay professional instead of personal

Apply:  S.T.A.R method

Situation:   Moving from one team to another

Task:                Decide what I was leaving behind and what is in the new role for me

Action:             Compared both roles, talked to my manager, growth opportunity, learning curve etc.

Result:              Finally decided to move

 Other examples:

·    Making decision when boss is out of the office

·    Deciding who to promote when you have several great candidates

·    Deciding whether you have to cut benefits that employees are used to receiving (like holiday bonuses)

·    Deciding who to terminate if layoffs become economically necessary

·    An example could be changing major was a hard decision
