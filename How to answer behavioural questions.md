How to answer behavioural questions
Please follow STAR methodology.
The STAR method is a structured manner of responding to a behavioural interview question by discussing the specific Situation, Task, Action and Result of what you're describing. This is beneficial if you want to succinctly highlight your experience and skills and back them up with contextualised examples.

Situation (30 sec)
·       Describe the situation that you were in or the task that you needed to accomplish. Give enough detail for the interviewer to understand the complexities of the situation.
·        
Task (30 sec)
How did you assess the situation and decide on a plan etc, who else was involved?

Action (1-2 mins)
The most important part of your answer! Here, your interviewer wants to understand your working styles and reflect on how you could work in Amazon.
Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail and keep the focus on you and your individual impact
What specific steps did you take? What was your particular contribution? Be careful that you don’t describe what the team or group did when talking about a project. Let us know what you actually did. Use the word “I,” not “we,” when describing actions.
What did you personally own?
How did you measure success for this project? (use data points to quantify your actions)

Result (40 sec -1 mins)
Describe the outcome of your actions and don’t be shy about taking credit for your behaviour or rather detailing any failures/learnings. What happened? How did the event end? What did you accomplish? What did you learn? Again, provide examples using metrics or data if applicable. It is also very important to reflect on what would you have done differently.
